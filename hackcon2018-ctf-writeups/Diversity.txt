We a string of random characers, these characters are either, binary, decimal, hex or octal literal
its all randomly encrypted, so theres not pattern to it
in my python script what we're gonna do is an if statement checking if its either any of those file types
thankfully it gives us a guide with the character that it starts with e.g x is hex and d is decimal
